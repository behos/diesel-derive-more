# models-derive

This package provides some helpers for working with diesel models.

# Provides

* DefaultInsertable: Creates a default struct to use as an insertable model
* DBEnum: Allows serializing and deserializing enums for DB storage

This is work in progress (created to support one of my projects) so it will continue to evolve.
